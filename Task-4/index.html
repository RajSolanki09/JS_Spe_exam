<body>
    you have to create three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
one, two, three <br>
â€¢ You have to find the square of the three numbers and find the sum of their square values
Note: The square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. <br>For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9 <br><br>
input <br> 
1 2 3 <br> <br>
output <br>
14 <br><br>
Hint <br>-- 
In the sample test case, the value stored in one = 1, two = 2, three = 3 <br>
The square of the values stored will be <br>
one = 1 * 1 = 1 <br>
two = 2 * 2 = 4 <br>
three = 3 * 3 = 9 <br>
The resultant sum becomes one + two + three = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the required answer.
