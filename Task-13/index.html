Hint
In the sample test case, the value stored in the variable number is 4. <br>
After multiplying the value by 3, the value gets updated to 12 <br>
After that, we add 7 to it, so the number gets updated to 19 <br> 
Finally, we subtract 10 from it, so the value becomes 9, which is the final output <br>
